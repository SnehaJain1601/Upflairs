  <h1> <mark> Favourite Hobby </mark></h1>
  <h2> <i><u>Spending Time with Friends</u></i></h2>
  <p>Spending time with friends is more than just a hobby for me.
    It is a source of happiness, emotional strength, and lifelong memories.
    In a world that often feels rushed and demanding, being with friends provides a comforting escape from the routine
    pressures of life.
    Whenever I am surrounded by my close friends, I feel a sense of belonging and warmth that cannot be replaced by
    anything else.
    We laugh together, share our thoughts freely, and support each other through every phase of life.
    These moments, no matter how simple they seem, become deeply meaningful.</p>
  <br><br>
  <p>Our time together is never just about having fun—though we have plenty of that—it’s also about connection,
    understanding, and shared growth.
    We go on spontaneous outings, watch movies, play games, have late-night talks, and celebrate even the smallest
    victories.
    Each activity, whether it's a long conversation or a short walk, becomes memorable when done with true friends.
    They have seen me at my best and stood by me at my worst, and that loyalty makes every moment we spend together feel
    special.
    What makes this hobby even more beautiful is that it doesn’t require anything fancy or expensive. Sometimes, sitting
    under the stars and talking for hours means more than any big party or outing.
    The genuine bond and laughter we share are what I treasure the most.
    These friendships have taught me the value of trust, empathy, and companionship, which are essential in all aspects
    of life.
    To me, spending time with friends is not just a way to pass time—it's a vital part of who I am and how I find joy in
    everyday life.

  <h1>My Daily Routine</h1>
  <h2>Morning</h2>
  <p> I start my day early with a refreshing cup of coffee and a short meditation session to clear my mind. After that,
    I go for a quick jog around the neighborhood. Once I’m back, I take a shower and have a healthy breakfast to get
    energized for the day ahead. </p>
  <h2>Afternoon</h2>
  <p> In the afternoon, I focus on my work or studies. I spend a few hours working on tasks, attending meetings, or
    learning something new. Around lunchtime, I take a break to enjoy a balanced meal and relax for a bit before
    continuing with my work. </p>
  <h2>Evening</h2>
  <p> In the evening, I like to unwind by spending time with my family or friends. I usually go for a walk or watch a
    movie. After dinner, I read a book or listen to music to relax. Before going to bed, I plan my next day and ensure I
    get a good night’s sleep. </p>
